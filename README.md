Here's the objective of the game:

> Get rid of all the cards one has as fast as possible by playing progressively stronger cards than those of the previous player. (Wikipedia)

Card Rank is:

```
3 < 4 < 5 < ... < 10 < J < Q < K < 1 < 2 < Joker
```

`3` is the weakest and `Joker` is the strongest card.

Enjoy the game!
